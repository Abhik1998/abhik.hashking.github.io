									<h3>Logo</h3>
								</header>
								<p>The symbol of SPIC MACAY is the "EYE" which represents Lord Shiva's third eye. According to Hindu mythology Parvati the consort of Lord Shiva playfully once blindfolded Him which clouded the world with profound darkness of ignorance and evil. The benevolent Lord then graced the world with bliss of knowledge and wisdom, opening is third eye on his forehead. This reveals one has to close his eyes to this materialistic and phony world in order to awaken the spiritual light from within.</p>

									<h3>Origin</h3>
								</header>
								<p>The “big bang” of SPIC MACAY came in 1972 at a concert of Ustad Aminuddin Dagar and Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York. The idea took a more defined direction in 1977 in India. In early 1978, a concert of the Dagar Bandhu, was held at IIT Delhi. In 1979, a two day programme again held at IIT Delhi of Ustad Bismillah Khan, Dagar Bandhu, Ustad Amjad Khan and Ustad Shahid Parvez. It was this in programme that the name SPIC MACAY was launched and the aim expressed was not to fight westernization but the process of deculturisation.</p>

									<h3>The Essence</h3>
								</header>
								<p>A priceless cultural heritage rooted in what is essentially Indian. SPIC MACAY seeks to conserve and promote an awareness of the rich and heterogeneous cultural tapestry amongst the youth and the country through focus on the classical arts, with their attendant legends, rituals, mythology and philosophy and to facilitate an awareness of their deeper and subtler values.</p>

<p>The pulsating and dyamic vitality of the young person. The movement incorporates this vitality to cajole them into being custodians od what is actually their birthright, namely their heritage, roots and identity. It seeks to promote thought and a genuine spirit of enquiry into the young. A solid value-based education, which involves the absorption of aesthtics and spirituality in an increasingly, technical , mundane, and competitive world. Thus it's work is educational in spirit and character and locates itself in educational institutions only.</p>>

<p>The spirit of 'Nishkama Karma' (service without expectation of rewards). Inculcating this is one of the main aims of SPIC MACAY.</p>

									<h3>Working</h3>
								</header>
								<p>"SPIC MACAY" has a central core-group based in Delhi. Chapters have been established not only in the larger cities, but also in many small towns. They function in liaison with the central group and have their office bearers who run them according to the constitution of the society. Schools and colleges have in turn formed sub-chapters which interact with the local chapter of the particular city/town.</p>
								<p>SPIC MACAY IIT Roorkee chapter is managed by group of students who work endlessly to spread it's message not only in the campus but also in neighboring institutions. Quite naturally, the organized programs are amazingly popular and well attended by both the students and faculty. It is purely funded by voluntary donations and sponsorships.</p>
								<p>The regular meetings held every week tend to be very lively and interactive with active participation from all the students. All students irrespective of their background share a very strong bond amongst them and are proud to call them as part of "SPIC MACAY family". For better management, we have divided our group into different cells such as Accommodation, Finance, Publicity, Media, Public Relations, Event Management, Web Designing.</p>
